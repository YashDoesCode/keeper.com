-   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
-   Social engineering or phishing attacks.
-   Physical attacks on our infrastructure.
-   Vulnerabilities in third-party services or applications we use.
-   Reports from automated scanners with no manual analysis.

-   Not accessing, modifying, or exfiltrating data that does not belong to you.
-   Not disrupting our services or harming our users.
