                    Privacy is central to Keeper’s philosophy. The platform uses zero-knowledge architecture combined with advanced on-device cryptography to ensure that user data remains private and available only to the rightful owner. Keeper’s design focuses on creating smooth and elegant user experiences by making complex security tasks simple and unobtrusive. With the cybersecurity threat landscape continuously changing, Keeper invests in ongoing research and development to stay ahead of new threats. Transparent communication about security measures and data protection helps build strong trust between Keeper and its users.
                    <br></br>
                    Yash’s journey into cybersecurity and cryptography began in 2021 when a popular password manager was hacked, resulting in the loss of all his stored accounts. This experience inspired him to deepen his knowledge and led to the creation of his own cryptographic model. This model reflects Yash’s commitment to privacy, security, and empowering users to protect themselves effectively. Keeper is a practical manifestation of these values, built to protect users from threats and vulnerabilities similar to those Yash encountered personally.
